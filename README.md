# spacefruit-game
Explore space and collect fruit in this little 2D gravity simulator for a CMU 15-112 term project.

ACCREDITATION
Not changing the code! I just forgot to point out some credits that I should've had in the video.
Background music of the Spacefruit trailer is entirely 'Selfless' by Eleven Tales. I take no credit for the music.

NOTES FOR RUNNING PROJECT
There's not much to it. Pull it up, controls should be immediately clear.

Notes:
- As with many space games, you are occasionally flung distantly into empty space at unreal speeds. It was probably the black hole.
-   To that end, there is a 'reset' key, [r], that will try to respawn you at home. Bar that, you will have to fly back or restart.
